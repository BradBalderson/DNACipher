**DNACipher is a DNA sequence deep learning model that also includes cell type and assay information on the model input.**

 Tutorials
-------
### The following tutorials are written in google collab, showing how to use the DNACipher Python interface.

* Tutorial 1: DNACipher inference of genetic variant effects

### DNACipher DVIM command-line-interface

In progress of implementing querying DNACipher and performing DVIM analysis using a command-line interface, so that R
users and non-Python programmers can utilize the model and analysis.
